Need to implement a way to have abilities with special series of effects:
    think of possible special abilities
    how do these abilities relate
    is there any common factors
    could they be implemented into the current ability class system
    if not how would the new ablity class function
    what are its variables and methods

Need to display enemy actions using a function rather than individually typing them all
    if possible make them red/move around to draw more attention
    communicate if enemy is vulnerable to attacks

Need to display ability descriptions
    put in ability screen or in another menu?
