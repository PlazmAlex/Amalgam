Communicate what ability an enemy will use
    Can enemys have more than one ablitiy?
    if so how to determine which one they will use
    how to communicate what the ability will do?

Get rid of loot functionality. Too confusing. Too much text on screen.
    possibly add the loot flavor after ablity is chosen to signify gaining ability.

Info screen
    displys stats?
    displays enemy abilities and what they do
    displays what guard does?
    keep it clean and simple
