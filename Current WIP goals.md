Need to implement a way to have abilities with special series of effects:
    think of possible special abilities
    how do these abilities relate
    is there any common factors
    could they be implemented into the current ability class system
    if not how would the new ablity class function
    what are its variables and methods

Communicate what ability an enemy will use
    Can enemys have more than one ablitiy?
    if so how to determine which one they will use
    how to communicate what the ability will do?
