Ideas

All actions are doubled

Better demon idea?
Can't attack on even turns

Guard -> Super -> Shriek -> Super -> Super (Repeat)

Bellow -> Super -> Bellow -> Heal (Repeat)

Burn -> Super -> Super -> Burn -> Strengthen -> Super -> Super (Repeat)

Enrage -> Super -> Super -> Enrage -> Eviscerate (Repeat)

Does whatever you do.

    displays enemy abilities and what they do
    displays what guard does?
    keep it clean and simple

#THings to focus on
